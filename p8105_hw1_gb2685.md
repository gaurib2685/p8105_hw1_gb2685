This is my solution to HW1:

*Loaded the packages that I need for this project.*

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

    ## ── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ──

```

## Problem 1

*Created a dataframe comprised of the specified elements:*

``` r
prob1_df = 
tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10),
    samp_gt_0 = samp > 0, 
    char_vec = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
    factor_vec = factor(c("low", "low", "low", "mod", "mod", "mod", "mod", "high", "high", "high" ))
)
```

*Take the mean of each variable in my data frame.*

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.2672821

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob1_df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(prob1_df, factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob1_df, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

I can take the means of numbers and logical but not character or factor
vectors. Logical gets understood by R as 1 or 0 and hence R at the
backend does that calculation for us and gives the mean

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, factor_vec))
```

I can convert the logical to numeric and convert the factor vectors to
numeric and then take means but could not convert the character vector
to numeric and hence could not take the mean. This explains why I could
not take the means for the character vector, but could take the mean for
the factor vector after I convert it to numeric.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0)) * pull(prob1_df, samp)
```

    ##  [1] 0.00000000 0.05375001 0.72701229 0.00000000 0.00000000 0.00000000
    ##  [7] 0.00000000 0.27028647 0.00000000 1.24309870

``` r
as.factor(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0)) * pull(prob1_df, samp)
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(as.factor(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0)), pull(prob1_df, : '*'
    ## not meaningful for factors

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))) * pull(prob1_df, samp)
```

## Problem 2

*I loaded the penguins dataset:*

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

#### Description of the dataset:

**Data, names and values of variables**

There are **344 observations** and **8 variables** in the dataset
*penguins*

*I want to explore which are the 8 variable names:*

The names of the variables in the dataset are - species, island,
bill\_length\_mm, bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g,
sex, year.

*I found the categories of species and islands and the number of
penguins pertaining to each species and island. I also calculated the
counts of male and female penguins:*

The three penguin species are Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo. The islands in
consideration are Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen. The counts of species are
Adelie =152 , Chinstrap = 68 and Gentoo = 124. There are 168 male
penguins and 165 female penguins.

*I calculated the distribution of penguin species on islands and their
mean bill and flipper lengths*

There are 44 Adelie penguins in the island Biscon with an average bill
length of 38.975 mm and average flipper length of 188.7954545

There are 56 Adelie penguins in the island Dream with an average bill
length of 38.5017857 mm and average flipper length of 189.7321429

There are 52 Adelie penguins in the island Torgersen with an average
bill length of 38.9509804 mm and average flipper length of 191.1960784

There are 68 Chinstrap penguins in the island Dream with an average bill
length of 48.8338235 mm and average flipper length of 195.8235294

There are 124 Gentoo penguins in the island Biscon with an average bill
length of 47.504878 mm and average flipper length of 217.1869919

*To find the mean size measurements for all penguins:*

The mean *bill length* for the penguins is 43.9219298 mm. The mean *bill
depth* for the penguins is 17.1511696 mm. The mean *flipper length* for
the penguins is 200.9152047 mm. The mean *body mass* for the penguins is
4201.754386 grams.

**Size of the dataset**

*I calculated the number of rows and columns in the dataset:*

There are 344 rows in the *penguins* dataset. There are 8 columns in the
*penguins* dataset.

**Mean flipper length**

*I calculated the mean flipper length.*

The mean flipper length is 200.9152047 mm.

#### Scatterplot:

*I made the following scatterplot:*

``` r
y = pull(penguins, flipper_length_mm)
x = pull(penguins, bill_length_mm)
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = x, y = y, color = species)) + geom_point() + labs(x="Bill length", y = "Flipper length") + ggtitle("Scatterplot of flipper length vs bill length of penguins")
```

*Received the following Warning <message:Removed> 2 rows containing
missing values (geom\_point). This could be because two rows had NA for
flipper length*
